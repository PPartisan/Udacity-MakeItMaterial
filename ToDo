Issues and Solutions:

Main
- Images do not scale properly in grid view.
	* Alter layouts such that image occupies entire background
	* Apply Scrim
	* Keep text
- Lack of contrast in text.
	* Adjust Text Colour such that it's inline with material specs
- App colours lack contrast (check MD specs)
	* Choose new colour sceme based on MD specs
- Ensure text fonts are the same.
	* If not, apply fonts consistently
- No transition animations.
	* Apply transition animations between image on click and in scrollable toolbar on Detail view.
	* Load in other content in stages (i.e. from bottom).

Detail
- Banner image scales poorly.
- Peculiarly large amount of white space before title.
	* Consult specs for correct AppBar height. Use Co-ordinator layout to apply parallax.
- I didn't know pages were scrollable! Should be a hint for this.
	* Could offer tabs, or could animated pages to slide in on load?

Done
- Margins already look good on landscape.
- App scales acceptably on different devices.
