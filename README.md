# Udacity-MakeItMaterial

Submission for fifth project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. This project makes the following adjustments to the base project, amongst others:

* Adjusts images so they match their parent containers with full bleed.
* Replaces any custom implementation of Material Design (MD) guidelines with equivalents from the Support Design Library, where practicable.
* Adjusts text font, size and colour to better match MD specs and improve legibility.
* Uses colour scheme that matches the feel of the original, but sourced from MD colour palette.
* Applies shared element transitions on Lollipop devices.
* Removes unnecessary white space.
